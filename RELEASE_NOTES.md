## data_magic (updated version)
- This gem is ported from the original data_magic gem -> [here](https://github.com/cheezy/data_magic). Please read the original documentation first.
I created this to make sure the gem stays updated with its dependencies. (The original gem seems to be unmaintained)
- Requirement:
  - Ruby >= 2.5.1
  - Faker >= 1.9
